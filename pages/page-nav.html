          <div>
            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="boxing1-0">Intro</h4>
            <p>Boxing is one of the most ancient forms of martial arts, which has gained popularity around the world
              due
              to
              its
              intensity, technique and discipline. This sport represents not only physical strength, but also
              strategic
              thinking, reaction and endurance.</p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="boxing1-1">Boxing history</h4>
            <p>The history of boxing goes back centuries. Back in ancient Rome and Greece, there were various
              forms of fighting
              without rules, which can be considered the ancestors of modern boxing. However, boxing, as a sport with
              rules
              and structure, became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries in England.</p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="boxing1-2">Boxing rules</h4>
            <p>One of the attractive aspects of boxing is its clear and strict rules. Boxing provides an
              opportunity to
              demonstrate physical strength and technique while protecting athletes from unnecessary danger. Boxers
              may
              use
              punches during a fight, but there are strict rules about where to punch and how.</p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="boxing1-3">Physical and psychological benefits</h4>

            <p> Boxing requires a high level of physical fitness. Boxing training includes exercises for endurance,
              coordination, strength and reaction speed. This helps improve overall fitness and also develops
              discipline
              and
              stamina.</p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="boxing1-4">Technique and strategy</h4>
            <p> Boxing is not just a fight between opponents, but also a real art where every movement matters. Boxing
              techniques include correct body positioning, blocking blows, accurate strikes and dodging. Athletes
              develop
              fighting strategies by analyzing their opponent's style and finding weak points for effective strikes.
            </p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="boxing1-5">Famous boxers</h4>
            <p>Boxing history is replete with legendary names such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis, Mike Tyson and
              many more. These athletes not only achieved outstanding results in the ring, but also became symbols of
              strength, endurance and
              courage.</p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="boxing1-6">Boxing and society</h4>
            <p>Boxing also has an impact on society by bringing discipline, self-control and fair play.
              Many people engage in
              boxing not only for sporting achievements, but also to strengthen character and develop personal
              qualities.
            </p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="boxing1-7">Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Boxing is not just a fight in the ring, it is an entire art that combines physical strength,
              technique and strategy. This sport attracts thousands of people around the world, giving them the
              opportunity
              to overcome

          <h2 class="subtitle" id="tenis4">Tenis: A Game of Strength, Dexterity and Strategy</h2>
          <div>
            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="tenis4-0">Intro</h4>
            <p>Tennis, considered one of the most popular and spectacular sports, combines elegance and physical
              endurance.
              The
              game, which began in the late 19th century, has gained worldwide popularity by providing players and
              spectators
              with a unique combination of strategy, dexterity and strength.</p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="tenis4-1">History of Tennis</h4>
            <p>Tennis, in its modern form, has its roots in France and Great Britain at the end of the 19th century.
              The
              game
              has undergone significant changes over the years, evolving from a road game to the format we know today
              with
              jackets and nets.</p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="tenis4-2">Rules of the game</h4>
            <p>Tennis is played on a rectangular court with a net in the middle. Singles and doubles games differ in
              the
              number
              of participants. The goal of the game is to send the ball to the opponent's side in such a way that he
              cannot
              return it. Players can use their rackets to hit and the ball must cross the net and land within the
              court.
            </p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="tenis4-3">Types of Coatings</h4>
            <p>Tennis courts can have different surfaces that affect the nature of the game. Clay courts are preferred
              for
              slow, tactical play, while grass courts provide fast, high-tech matches. Hard courts, such as hard
              courts,
              provide a balance between speed and ball control.</p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="tenis4-4">Tennis Stars</h4>
            <p>Tennis has produced many famous and legendary players. For decades, tennis courts have been the
              battleground
              of
              names such as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Margaret Court, Bjorn Borg
              and
              many
              more. These athletes have become icons in the world of tennis, winning titles and fans with their
              masterful
              play.</p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="tenis4-5">Tournaments and Grand Slams</h4>
            <p>Tennis offers a rich kaleidoscope of tournaments, among which four Grand Slams stand out: the
              Australian
              Open,
              the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. These tournaments are the pinnacle of professional tennis
              and
              attract the attention of millions of fans around the world.</p>

            <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="tenis4-6">Physical Fitness and Training</h4>
