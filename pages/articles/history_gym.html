      <div class="first-letter-box">
        <p class="first-letter">Massive gyms (rocking chairs) began to appear in 1950 and were places where mainly men
          who
          were interested in
          bodybuilding or weightlifting trained. These guys mainly developed muscle performance and sought to increase
          muscle mass, at any cost.</p>

        <p class="first-letter">More experienced athletes acted as trainers in such gyms, who gave recommendations on
          how
          many approaches
          should
          be done and how many repetitions. They relied solely on their sports experience and did not take into account
          the
          science, capabilities and needs of the Client.</p>

        <p class="first-letter">In 1951, a certain Jack Lalane began hosting a fitness show on a popular national
          television channel. Jack
          promoted health-improving exercises and calorie control in his shows, changing the vector of fitness
          development
          towards
          health. The show was very popular and aired until 1984.</p>

        <p class="first-letter">In the 1960s, women's studios, or “figure salons” as they were then called, began to
          gain
          popularity. They were
          already focused on losing weight and creating a slim figure. In these salons, instead of dumbbells and other
          fitness equipment, they mainly used simulators that did vibration massage. Such fitness on the couch</p>

        <p class="first-letter">Also in the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy changed the name of the “Ministry” of Youth
          Affairs to the
          “Ministry” of Physical Education, now addressing this message not only to teenagers, but to the entire adult
          population. This
          provided significant support in the popularization of fitness and a healthy lifestyle in America.</p>

        <p class="first-letter">In 1965, the first club of the global Gold Gym network was opened, which was imbued with
          the spirit of
          Bodybuilding and the embodiment of the movie “Pump Iron”. In the 70s and 80s, fitness clubs became
          increasingly
          accessible and popular. Men and women of all ages trained together indoors and outdoors, creating strong
          communities through
          healthy lifestyles and communication.</p>

        <p class="first-letter">And the organization of mass “sports” events encouraged people to develop physical
          qualities, becoming
          stronger,
          faster, more dexterous. The fitness movement was actively gaining momentum.</p>

        <p class="first-letter">But the concept of a fitness trainer has not yet been formed. These were the same
          enthusiasts who trained by
          experience, by feeling. Despite this, the growth of the fitness industry as a whole has led to people looking
          for
          help getting into the gym and being willing to pay for it. This is how to form a profession as a personal
          trainer.
        </p>

        <p class="first-letter">In those years, it was not practice to ask the Client questions about previous
          experiences, illnesses, and
          goals.
          The training programs were formulaic, not based on the capabilities of each individual Client. The situation
          changed when Americans paid attention to how many people suffer from chronic diseases and how this harms their
          economy.</p>

        <p class="first-letter">Awareness of these factors has led to the development of the personal trainer profession
          in a broader area than
          just a beautiful body. The emergence of Academies, which lay the foundation in the form of basic knowledge of
          the
          human structure + research, made trainers people who prolong life, help to work and spend free time more
          effectively.
          They also enable Clients to live enjoying developed functional abilities and a beautiful body.</p>

        <p class="first-letter">Why did I decide to write this story? It seems to me that it is being repeated with a
          great delay in another
          country that is not indifferent to me. What stage do you think fitness is at in Ukraine?</p>
