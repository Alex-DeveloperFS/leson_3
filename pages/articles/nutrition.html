      <div class="first-letter-box">
        <p class="first-letter">A healthy diet throughout the lifespan helps prevent malnutrition in all its forms, as
          well as a range of
          noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and health conditions. However, the rise of processed foods, rapid
          urbanization
          and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in
          calories, fat, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people are not consuming enough fruits, vegetables and
          other
          types of
          fiber such as whole grains.</p>

        <p class="first-letter">The exact composition of a varied, balanced and healthy diet depends on individual
          characteristics (such as age,
          gender, lifestyle and level of physical activity), cultural context, local food availability and dietary
          customs.
          However, the basic principles of healthy eating remain the same.</p>

        <p class="first-letter">For adults A healthy diet includes the following components</p>

        <p class="first-letter">Fruits, vegetables, legumes (eg, lentils, beans), nuts, and whole grains (eg,
          unprocessed
          corn, millet, oats,
          wheat, nd brown rice).</p>

        <p class="first-letter">At least 400g (that is, five servings) of fruits and vegetables per day (2), excluding
          potatoes, sweet potatoes,
          cassava and other starchy root vegetables.</p>

        <p class="first-letter">Free sugars should make up less than 10% of total energy intake (2, 7), which is
          equivalent to 50 g (or 12 level
          teaspoons) for a normal weight person consuming about 2000 calories per day, but ideally to provide additional
          health benefits, they should account for less than 5% of total energy intake (7). Free sugars are all sugars
          added
          to foods or beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, as well as sugars naturally present in honey,
          syrups,
          fruit juices and their concentrates.</p>

        <p class="first-letter">Fats should make up less than 30% of total energy intake (1, 2, 3). It is necessary to
          give preference to
          unsaturated fats (found in fish, avocados and nuts, as well as sunflower, soybean, canola and olive oils) as
          opposed to saturated fats (found in fatty meats, butter, palm and coconut oils, cream, cheese, ghee). and lard
          and
          trans fats of all types, including both industrially produced trans fats (found in baked and fried foods,
          pre-packaged
          snack foods and other foods such as frozen pizzas, pies, cookies, waffles, cooking oils and sandwich mixes)
          and
          trans fats naturally occurring (contained in meat and dairy products obtained from ruminant animals such as
          cows,
          sheep, goats and camels).</p>

        <p class="first-letter">It is recommended to reduce saturated fat intake to less than 10% and trans fat to less
          than 1% of total energy intake (5). You should especially avoid consuming industrially produced trans fats,
          which
          are not part of a healthy diet (4, 6).</p>

        <p class="first-letter">Consume less than 5 g of salt (equivalent to about one teaspoon) per day (8). Salt must
          be
          iodized.</p>
